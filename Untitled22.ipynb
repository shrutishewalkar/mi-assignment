    "Ans: essemble technique in machine learning involve combination multiple models or algorithms to improve the overall performance of a machine learning model.the basic idea behind ensemble technique is to leverage the diversity of different models and to use their strengths to compensate for the weaknesses of other models. they are used for both classification and regression tasks.there are two types of ensemble techniques.\n",
    "1. Bagging : this involves building multiple models using random subsets of the training data and combining their predictions.\n",
    "2. Boosting: this involves building multiple models sequentially , where each subsequent model is trained to correct the error made by the previous model.\n"
